Explain this code

This code is a simple Python program that displays a calendar for a given month and year. Here's an explanation of the code:

1 Import the calendar module: This module provides functions for working with calendars, including printing a calendar for 
    a specified month and year.

2 Define the display_calendar function: This function takes two arguments year and month, which represent the year and month 
    for which the calendar should be displayed.

3 Create a calendar: The calendar.monthcalendar(year, month) function is used to create a matrix representing the calendar 
    for the specified month and year. The matrix contains one row for each week of the month, and each row has seven elements 
    representing the days of the week (Monday through Sunday).

4 Get the month name: The calendar.month_name[month] dictionary maps the month number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) 
    to the month name. This is used to display the name of the month at the top of the calendar.

5 Print the calendar: The calendar is printed by looping over each row of the matrix and printing the day numbers for each day 
    of the week. If the day number is 0, it means there is no day in that position (for example, the first row of a calendar 
    may start with a blank day or two if the month starts later in the week). In this case, a blank line is printed. 

7 Test the program: Finally, the program is tested by calling display_calendar with the year and month arguments set to 2022 
    and 2, respectively. This will display the calendar for February 2022.
